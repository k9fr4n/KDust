# Automation push pipeline

When a task has `pushEnabled = true`, KDust automates the full
post-agent git flow: branching, committing, pushing, and opening a
PR/MR. The agent only has to **edit files via fs-cli** and describe
what it did — KDust handles every `git` call from the working-tree
diff.

This doc walks through the 10-stage pipeline in `runTask()`
(`src/lib/cron/runner.ts`), the branch-policy resolution, the
guard-rails, and the PR/MR auto-opener.

---

## When does it run?

| `pushEnabled` | Pipeline behaviour |
|--|--|
| `true`  | Full 10-stage pipeline (below). Prompt is augmented with a KDust-automation context footer. |
| `false` | Prompt-only mode: agent runs, its reply is stored as `TaskRun.output`, nothing is committed/pushed. Prompt is sent verbatim. |

`pushEnabled` is forced to `false` for generic tasks (no project
→ no repo). See [`docs/tasks.md`](tasks.md) for the generic-task
invariants.

## Stage details

### [1] Concurrency lock

A per-project mutex held for the entire pipeline. Two writing
tasks on the same `projectPath` serialise to avoid racing on
`git reset --hard`, branch creation, and the working tree. If
another run of the **same task** is already `running`, this run is
refused with `status='skipped'` — prevents pile-up when a cron
period is shorter than the run duration.

Child runs spawned via `run_task` from the same orchestrator run
**bypass** the lock, otherwise an orchestrator would deadlock on
its own branch.

### [2] Pre-run git sync

```
git fetch origin
git checkout <baseBranch>
git reset --hard origin/<baseBranch>
git clean -fd
```

Guarantees every run starts from a clean, up-to-date base tree.
The agent never sees stale state from a previous run.

### [3] Branch setup

Two modes, selectable per task via `branchMode`:

| Mode           | Branch name | Push flags |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| `timestamped` (default) | `<branchPrefix>/<task.name>/YYYYMMDD-HHMM`  | plain `git push` — new branch every run |
| `stable`       | `<branchPrefix>/<task.name>`               | `git push --force-with-lease` — same branch reused, PR is updated in place |

`timestamped` is the safe default: each run is an independent
branch, trivial to revert. `stable` is useful for iterative
tasks where you want a single long-lived PR that evolves.

Before creating the branch, KDust refuses if the resolved name
matches any entry in `protectedBranches`. This is a
**belt-and-suspenders** check on top of the branch-name construction:
impossible by design in `timestamped` mode (always prefixed), but
`stable` can be misconfigured.

### [4] MCP fs register

The runner registers the `fs-cli` MCP server chrooted to
`/projects/<projectPath>` so the agent can read / write / search
within the project but nowhere else. This is the ONLY writable
filesystem surface for the agent during the run.

If `taskRunnerEnabled=true`, the `task-runner` MCP server is also
registered — see [`docs/task-runner.md`](task-runner.md).

If `commandRunnerEnabled=true`, the `command-runner` MCP server is
registered with the project chroot and the task's secret bindings.

### [5] Dust agent run

`createConversation` + `streamAgentReply`, with a 10-minute
timeout. The final assistant message is stored as
`TaskRun.output`. The Dust conversation is linked from the run
page via a chat icon for post-run forensics.

The prompt sent is:

```
<Task.prompt>

---
[KDust automation context]
This run will be auto-committed (and pushed unless dry-run) by KDust after your reply.
- Base branch: <baseBranch>
- Branch mode: <branchMode>
- Branch prefix: <branchPrefix>
- Dry-run: yes|no
- Max diff lines: <maxDiffLines> (KDust aborts the push if exceeded)
Do NOT run `git add` / `git commit` / `git push` yourself — KDust handles
all git writes from the working-tree diff after your reply. Just edit files
via the fs-cli MCP server as needed and explain your changes in your reply.
```

The footer is the single most reliable way to stop agents from
running their own `git commit` via shell tools.

### [6] Diff measurement

```
git add -A
git diff --cached --numstat
```

Produces the three key metrics: `filesChanged`, `linesAdded`,
`linesRemoved`. These end up on the `TaskRun` row and in the
Teams card.

### [7] Guard-rails

| Condition              | Action                                  |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `filesChanged == 0`    | `status='no-op'`, branch deleted locally, return. Teams card is an info banner. |
| `linesAdded + linesRemoved > maxDiffLines` | `throw` → status `'failed'`. The agent's output is preserved so you can inspect what it tried to do. |

The diff cap is the single most important **hallucination safety
net** — an agent that decides to rewrite 15 files with 3000 lines
of wrong code is refused, not pushed.

Default `maxDiffLines = 2000`. Raise per-task when needed
(refactors, generated code), never disable.

### [8] Commit + push

```
git commit -m "chore(<branchPrefix>): <task.name>

Automated by KDust cron "<task.name>".
Agent: <agentName|agentSId>
Base: origin/<baseBranch>
Files: <N> | +<linesAdded> / -<linesRemoved>"
```

Author: `KDust Bot <kdust-bot@ecritel.net>`.

Push is skipped entirely if `dryRun = true` — the commit stays
local so you can inspect it on the host's `/projects/<name>`
working tree. Status is still `success`.

### [8b] Auto-open PR/MR

Triggered when **all** of these hold:

- push actually happened (not dry-run)
- `Project.autoOpenPR = true`
- the project's platform config is valid (GitHub token or GitLab token)

Current support:

| Platform | API call | Token scope |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| GitHub   | `gh pr create` equivalent via REST | `repo` |
| GitLab   | Merge Requests API | `api` |

Failure at this stage is **non-fatal** for the run: the branch is
already pushed, `prState='failed'` is recorded, the Teams card
surfaces the error, and the user can open the MR manually.

### [9] Persist TaskRun

Final UPDATE on the `TaskRun` row:

```
status, phase='done', phaseMessage='Completed',
branch, commitSha, filesChanged, linesAdded, linesRemoved,
output (the agent reply), prUrl, prNumber, prState,
finishedAt = now()
```

Also updates `Task.lastRunAt` and `Task.lastStatus` for the list
page.

### [10] Teams notification

Adaptive card posted to `Task.teamsWebhook` (falls back to
`Project.teamsWebhook` if null). Three variants:

- **success**: green, with branch/commit/PR links, diff stats
- **no-op**: blue info banner, no links
- **failure**: red, with the error + truncated agent output

Webhook failure is swallowed (logged only) — never fails the run.

## Branch policy resolution

Branch-related fields have a **task overrides project** relationship.
See `src/lib/branch-policy.ts`:

| Field               | Project field          | Task field          | Resolution |
|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------|------------|
| baseBranch          | `defaultBaseBranch`    | `baseBranch`        | task ≠ null ? task : project |
| branchPrefix        | `branchPrefix`         | `branchPrefix`      | task ≠ null ? task : project |
| protectedBranches   | `protectedBranches`    | `protectedBranches` | task ≠ null ? task : project |

The `branchMode` / `dryRun` / `maxDiffLines` fields are task-only
(inherently per-task).

**Tip**: set sensible defaults on the Project once (e.g. `main`,
`kdust`, `main,master,develop`) and leave task-level overrides
NULL. Only override when a specific task needs a different rule
(e.g. a "release-notes" task targeting `release` branch).

---

## Project-level settings

Managed at `/settings/projects/<name>`:

| Field                | Purpose |
|----------------------|---------|
| `defaultBaseBranch`  | inherited by all tasks unless overridden |
| `branchPrefix`       | enforced prefix (default `kdust`) |
| `protectedBranches`  | CSV of forbidden targets |
| `autoOpenPR`         | master switch for stage [8b] |
| `platform`           | `github` / `gitlab` / `none` |
| `githubToken` / `gitlabToken` | secret (stored encrypted, rotated via UI) |
| `teamsWebhook`       | fallback for task-less webhook override |

---

## Dry-run mode (`dryRun = true`)

Stops before the network push. Useful for:

- Testing a new task's behaviour without littering the remote
- Manually reviewing commits in `/projects/<name>` before letting
  KDust push them
- CI-like sanity checks that shouldn't auto-merge

A dry-run that **succeeds** still records `status='success'`, has
a valid `commitSha`, but `prUrl=null` and no remote branch. The
working tree is cleaned up to `origin/<baseBranch>` at the NEXT
run's stage [2].

---

## Troubleshooting

### `push failed: error: failed to push some refs`

Usually a protected-branch hook on the remote rejecting the push.
Check the remote's branch-protection rules; the target branch
(the work branch, not the base) may be blocked by `required status
checks` or `allow pushes from admins only`.

### `aborting push: target branch <X> is protected`

Our own belt-and-suspenders check. `<X>` matched an entry in the
resolved `protectedBranches` list. In `stable` mode, the stable
branch name must NOT collide with protected ones — change
`branchPrefix` or the task name.

### `diff too large: exceeds maxDiffLines`

Hallucination guard tripped. Three options:

1. Bump `maxDiffLines` on the task if the change is genuinely large.
2. Refine the prompt to produce a smaller, more focused change.
3. Inspect the attempted diff in `/projects/<name>` (still in the
   working tree at that point) and decide whether it's
   salvageable manually.

### PR didn't open (`prState='failed'`)

Check:

- `Project.autoOpenPR = true`
- Platform config is set (token + platform = github/gitlab)
- Token has the right scope (`repo` / `api`)
- The Teams card's error field carries the API response body

Fix the token / config, then re-run the task; the branch is
already there, the push will no-op and the PR opener runs on the
refresh.

### Task ran but no commit appeared

Likely `status='no-op'` (no file changes) — check `/runs/<id>`.
The agent ran, replied, but didn't write anything. If that's
wrong, inspect the agent's reply: it may have described changes
without actually calling fs-cli's `edit_file`.
